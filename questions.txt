0.  How many different colors does each format support?

BMP: 64 Bits per pixel, 2^64 colors.
GIF: 8 Bits per pixel, 2^8 colors.
JPEG: 24 Bits per pixel, 2^24 colors.
PNG: 64 Bits per pixel, 2^64 colors.

2.  Whatâ€™s the difference between 
    lossy and lossless compression?

Lossy compression is a class of data compression
methods that that uses inexact approximations
(or partial data discarding) to represent the content.
It does this to produce a smaller compressed file.
Example: A high resolution image -> "pixel-y" image.

Lossless compression is a class of data 
compression algorithms that allows 
the original data to be perfectly 
reconstructed from the compressed data. 
This requires bigger compressed files.
Example: A high resolution image -> still "sharp" image.
